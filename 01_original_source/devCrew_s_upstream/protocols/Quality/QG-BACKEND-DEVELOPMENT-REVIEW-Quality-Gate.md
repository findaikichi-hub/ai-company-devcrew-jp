## Trigger

### Automatic Triggers
- When backend code changes exceed complexity threshold (>500 lines of business logic): Complexity review required
- When API contracts are modified or new endpoints introduced: Contract validation needed
- When database schema migrations are required: Schema impact assessment
- When security-sensitive code is modified (authentication, authorization, data access): Security review mandatory
- When performance-critical components are updated: Performance validation required
- When third-party dependencies are updated or added: Dependency security scan
- When configuration changes impact production systems: Configuration review needed

### Manual Triggers
- After Backend-Engineer completes all implementation tasks for Framework Phase 4: Phase completion validation
- Before transitioning to Phase 6 (Integration & System Testing): Phase gate enforcement

### HITL Triggers
- Orchestrator enforces as HITL gate during Phase 2 (Implementation): Human Command Group approval required

## Prerequisites

- Backend code implementation complete and committed to feature branch via **TOOL-COLLAB-001**
- Unit tests written with adequate test coverage using **TOOL-TEST-001**
- API documentation created (OpenAPI/Swagger specifications) accessible via **TOOL-COLLAB-001**
- Access to **TOOL-COLLAB-001** (GitHub Integration), **TOOL-SEC-001** (SAST Scanner), **TOOL-TEST-001** (Load Testing), **TOOL-CICD-001** (Pipeline Platform), **TOOL-DATA-002** (Statistical Analysis)
- Code quality standards and thresholds defined and configured via **TOOL-DATA-002**
- Security scanning tools configured and operational through **TOOL-SEC-001**
- Test coverage requirements established (e.g., ≥80% unit test coverage, ≥70% integration test coverage) via **TOOL-TEST-001**
- Performance baselines and SLO targets documented using **TOOL-DATA-002**
- Database migration scripts prepared with rollback procedures using **TOOL-CICD-001**

## Steps

1. **Code Quality Check**: Execute static code analysis, run linters (flake8, pylint, black, isort), perform code complexity analysis (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index), detect code smells and architectural violations using **TOOL-DATA-002**

2. **Security Scan (SAST)**: Execute static application security testing via **TOOL-SEC-001**, scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities, authentication/authorization flaws, dependency vulnerabilities, validate input validation patterns and error handling security

3. **Test Execution and Coverage**: Run unit tests and integration tests using **TOOL-TEST-001**, measure test coverage (line, branch, function coverage), validate coverage threshold compliance (≥80% unit, ≥70% integration), verify P-TDD protocol compliance

4. **API Contract Validation**: Verify API specifications match implementation using **TOOL-COLLAB-001**, validate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation completeness, check for breaking changes in API contracts, execute API contract testing

5. **Performance Benchmarking**: Execute performance tests and load testing via **TOOL-TEST-001**, measure API response times (p95, p99), validate against performance baselines and SLO targets, analyze database query performance using **TOOL-DATA-002**

6. **Documentation Review**: Verify API documentation completeness and accuracy via **TOOL-COLLAB-001**, check inline code comments and docstrings, validate README and setup documentation, ensure deployment and configuration documentation is current

7. **Approval/Rejection Decision**: Aggregate all validation results, calculate weighted quality score using **TOOL-DATA-002**, make gate decision (PASS/FAIL), if PASS: transition to Phase 5 (Frontend Development), if FAIL: generate remediation plan and block phase transition

## Expected Outputs

- **Quality gate pass/fail status** with detailed decision rationale
- **Code quality report** with metrics (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, code duplication percentage) and violations list generated by **TOOL-DATA-002**
- **Security scan results** with vulnerability findings classified by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), remediation recommendations from **TOOL-SEC-001**
- **Test coverage report** with percentage achieved (unit test coverage, integration test coverage, critical path coverage), coverage gaps identified by **TOOL-TEST-001**
- **API validation results** documenting contract compliance status, breaking changes detected (if any), implementation alignment analysis from **TOOL-COLLAB-001**
- **Performance benchmark results** including API response times (mean, p50, p95, p99), throughput metrics, resource utilization analysis from **TOOL-TEST-001** and **TOOL-DATA-002**
- **Approval for Phase 5 (Frontend Development)** OR **rejection with specific remediation requirements** documented via **TOOL-COLLAB-001**

## Failure Handling

- **Code quality below threshold**: Document specific violations (complexity too high, code smells detected, naming convention violations), require refactoring to meet quality standards, block phase transition until code quality threshold achieved, escalate to Technical-Lead if extensive refactoring required

- **Security vulnerabilities found**: Classify vulnerabilities by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), create security remediation tickets via **TOOL-COLLAB-001**, block phase transition if Critical or High severity vulnerabilities detected, require security code review and validation, notify security team for Critical vulnerabilities

- **Insufficient test coverage**: Identify specific coverage gaps (untested functions, missing edge cases, uncovered critical paths), require additional unit and integration tests, block phase transition until minimum coverage threshold met (≥80% unit, ≥70% integration), provide specific test case recommendations

- **API contract violations**: Document breaking changes and contract mismatches, require API specification updates or implementation fixes, determine if API version increment needed, block phase transition until contract compliance achieved, coordinate with frontend team on breaking changes

- **Performance degradation**: Compare performance metrics to established baselines, identify specific performance bottlenecks (slow queries, inefficient algorithms, resource contention), require performance optimization before proceeding, escalate to System-Architect if severe performance issues detected, may require architecture review

- **Missing documentation**: List specific documentation gaps (missing API endpoint docs, incomplete setup instructions, missing deployment guide), require documentation completion for critical sections, block phase transition if critical documentation missing, allow conditional approval for non-critical documentation with follow-up tasks

- All backend implementation tasks completed with comprehensive documentation via **TOOL-COLLAB-001**

- **API Contract Compliance**: OpenAPI spec matches implementation with zero discrepancies
- **Security Assurance**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities, comprehensive SAST/DAST validation passed
- **Performance Excellence**: API response time <200ms (95th percentile), load testing SLOs met
- **Code Quality Standards**: SonarQube quality gate ≥B, cyclomatic complexity <15, architecture compliance validated

## Advanced Integration with Orchestrator

### Enhanced Orchestrator Integration Requirements
**Current State**: ❌ MISSING from Orchestrator HITL gates
**Required Changes for DevGru Framework v2.1 Integration**:

#### Part IV (HITL Triggers) Addition:
```
* **Trigger:** Backend Review Gate (QG-PHASE4). After comprehensive backend validation including test coverage analysis, security scanning, performance validation, API contract verification, and database migration safety assessment, backend implementation MUST receive Human Command Group approval confirming production readiness before proceeding to integration phase (Phase 6).
```

#### Table 3 Update (Protocol Adherence Matrix):
```
QG-PHASE4 | Backend-Development-Review-Quality-Gate | Executor | Quality validation for backend implementation with HITL approval
```

#### Part VIII Phase 2 Integration Enhancement:
```
* After Backend-Engineer completes all implementation tasks:
  1. Submit backend artifacts to QG-PHASE4 for comprehensive validation
  2. Execute automated validation across 8 quality dimensions
  3. Generate comprehensive quality report with recommendations
  4. If QG-PHASE4 achieves PASS status, trigger HITL gate for Human Command Group approval
  5. Only proceed to Phase 6 (Integration & System Testing) after explicit human approval
  6. If QG-PHASE4 FAIL status, block progression and execute remediation workflow
```
